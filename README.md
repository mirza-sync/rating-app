ðŸ‘† This was a pretty good tutorial. It teaches basic of vue that is useful in real world application. It demonstrated a mix between Composition API and Options API, API fetching using fake database (json-server) and the use of Pinia store. His explanation can be improved a lil bit, but overall it covers a lot of aspects of Vue.
